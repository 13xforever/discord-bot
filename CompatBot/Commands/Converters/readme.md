Converters
==========

Here we have custom converter classes that could be used with DSharpPlus library.

`TextOnlyDiscordChannelConverter`
---------------------------------

This converter is used to more easily parse channel names to their respective library object, that prevents most common issues (such as trying to send messages in a voice or a category channel).

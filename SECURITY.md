# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Current .NET version of the bot is supported (`master` branch).

Old python verion is only for historical purposes

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Best way to report an issue with the code is to send DM to mods in [RPCS3 discord server](https://discord.me/rpcs3) or an email to the repot maintainer (see github profiles).

We'll fix any issue that can threaten safety of user data, bot or discord server availability or normal operation as fast as humanly possible.

You can expect at the very least the thread assessment and proposed actions within a day, bar special circumstances.

You can also expect inclusion in the list of people who ~~broke~~ helped test the bot for posterity (we'll ask for emoji to represent you beforehand).

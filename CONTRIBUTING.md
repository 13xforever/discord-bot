Introduction
============
Please read [general architecture overview](architecture.md) of the project and it's parts (each folder contains a README.md with its content description).

Unfortunately not all parts are documented right now, and some things might be slightly outdated / missing information about newer pieces of code.

You can always ask for help/clarification/explanation in our [Discord server](https://discord.me/RPCS3).

Just to reiterate, the main concerns are:
1. Code quality. The bot is used on a highly populated server, so performance and resource management can be an issue.
2. In-depth defense for potential bot misuse. See #1. Many people means many pranksters, or worse. No everyone is nice.
3. Having fun. This is a project for recreational programming, so if you always wanted to do something fun and it seems to be useful for the bot, just do it.

Recommended development setup
=============================
See [readme](README.md) for detailed requirement and recommended IDE setup.

**Note** that Docker image is currently experimental and wasn't tested in any way.
